"Table 14. Had Serious Thoughts of Suicide in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Estimated Numbers (in Thousands), Annual Averages Based on 2014 and 2015 NSDUHs",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Respondents were asked, ""At any time in the past 12 months, did you seriously think about trying to kill yourself?"" If they answered ""Yes,"" they were categorized as having serious thoughts of suicide in the past year. ",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 (because estimated numbers are shown in thousands).,,,,,,,,,,
