"Table 11. Alcohol Dependence in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Estimated Numbers (in Thousands), Annual Averages Based on 2014 and 2015 NSDUHs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Dependence is based on the definition found in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 (because estimated numbers are shown in thousands).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
