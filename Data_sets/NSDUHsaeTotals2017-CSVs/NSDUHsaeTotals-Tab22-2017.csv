"Table 22. Alcohol Use Disorder in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Estimated Numbers (in Thousands), Annual Averages Based on 2016 and 2017 NSDUHs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Alcohol Use Disorder is defined as meeting criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse. Dependence or abuse is based on definitions found in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 (because estimated numbers are shown in thousands).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
