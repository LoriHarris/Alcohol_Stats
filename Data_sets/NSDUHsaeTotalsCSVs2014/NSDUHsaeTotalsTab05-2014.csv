"Table 5. Average Annual Marijuana Initiates, by Age Group and State: Estimated Numbers (in Thousands), Based on 2013 and 2014 NSDUHs  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Average annual number of marijuana initiates = X1 / 2, where X1 is the number of marijuana initiates in the past 24 months. For details, see Section B of the ""2011-2012 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology"" at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
