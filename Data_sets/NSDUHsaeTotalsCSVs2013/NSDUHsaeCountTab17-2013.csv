"Table 17. Alcohol Dependence in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Estimated Numbers (in Thousands), Annual Averages Based on 2012 and 2013 NSDUHs  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Dependence is based on the definition found in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
